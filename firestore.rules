/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for BookEase Accommodations
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for Customers and Owners,
 * and an owner-access model for Accommodations. Bookings are secured under
 * customer paths with denormalized customer IDs for authorization independence.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Customer profiles, accessible only by the customer.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Bookings made by a specific customer, accessible only by that customer.
 * - /accommodations/{accommodationId}: Accommodation listings, accessible by anyone for reading, but writable only by the owner.
 * - /owners/{ownerId}: Owner profiles, accessible only by the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users (Customers and Owners) can only access their own profiles and data.
 * - Accommodation reads are public, but writes are restricted to the owner.
 * - Bookings are private and scoped to the customer who made them.
 * - No listing of users (Customers or Owners) is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Accommodation documents contain the `ownerId` to allow owner-only write rules without extra `get()` calls.
 * - Booking documents contain the `customerId` to allow customer-only access to bookings under their path.
